  <h3>Introduction to
junior cycle</h3>
  
  <p>
  Junior cycle education places students at the centre of the educational experience, enabling them
to actively participate in their communities and in society and to be resourceful and confident
learners in all aspects and stages of their lives. Junior cycle is inclusive of all students and

  <h3 class="margin">What is Geography?</h3>
  <p>Geography is the study of the Earth’s landscapes, peoples, places, and environments. It adheres to
the scientific method and pursues scientific principles and logic. The study of geography empowers
the person to explore and understand the world around them. Engagement with the subject
promotes a deep understanding of people and place. Students develop the skills to read their
environment, enabling them to interpret the physical landscape, observe climatic events with
an informed eye and discuss world events in a knowledgeable manner. Learning in geography
supports students in making informed decisions, giving the ability to make valuable contributions
to the economic, social, and cultural life of their communities, localities and countries.
Through the study of geography, people are encouraged to appreciate the processes that shape
their world and view global issues as ethical citizens. Geography provides a platform to analyse
world events, empowering young people as informed, active citizens. Studying geography
enhances students’ ability to engage with issues such as sustainable development, economic
systems, hazard management and climate change. The topics experienced help develop students’
awareness and understanding of cultural variations fostering a respect of difference.
Students are growing up in a globalised, dynamic world. Geography provides a medium to explore
current events in our world. Students viewing events through a geographical lens are well placed
to be part of a generation which can deal effectively with and mitigate global challenges, and can
rise to related opportunities.</p><br>

      <p>The study of Junior Cycle Geography enables students to become geographically literate.
It stimulates curiosity, creating opportunities for students to read, analyse, synthesise and
communicate about their immediate environment and wider world. It develops knowledge, skills,
values and behaviours that allow students to explore the physical world, human activities, how we
interact with our world and to recognise the interconnections between systems. </p>
